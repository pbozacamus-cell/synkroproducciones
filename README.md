# Canva → HTML (Tailwind) Starter

This workspace contains a starter static site converted from a Canva design using the Tailwind CDN for styles.

What I added
- `index.html` — Tailwind-based responsive starter template.
- `js/scripts.js` — Mobile nav toggle + footer year.
- `assets/` — place your exported images and `logo.svg` here.

How to use
1. Export your Canva pages as PNGs (one file per page) and any logos as SVG.
2. Put images into the `assets/` folder and update `index.html` image paths.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview.

If you want a production Tailwind build (recommended for performance), I can scaffold an npm + Tailwind build pipeline next.

Next steps I can do for you
- Replace placeholders to match each Canva page
- Add custom fonts and color variables (if you upload font files and hex codes)
- Create a build pipeline with Tailwind CLI or Vite
